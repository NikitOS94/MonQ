installation. It is available from
[github](https://github.com/NikitOS94/MonQ)
and supports PostgreSQL 9.4+.

[github](https://github.com/NikitOS94/MonQ) and PostgreSQL 9.4 or higher.

Before build and install you should ensure following:
    
 * PostgreSQL version is 9.4 or higher.
 * Installed JsQuery extension.
 * You have development package of PostgreSQL installed or you built
   PostgreSQL from source.
 * You have flex and bison installed on your system.

    $ cd monq
    $ make USE_PGXS=1
    $ sudo make USE_PGXS=1 install
    $ make USE_PGXS=1 installcheck
    $ psql DB -c "CREATE EXTENSION monq;"

### Usage

MonQ extension contains:
* `mquery` - datatype which represents MongoDB query in tree structure;
* `<=>` - maching operator which take like arguments jsonb document and 
mongoDB query. This operator have 2 variants of representation: 
`jsonb <=> mquery` and `mquery <=> jsonb`.

Example of query:

```
select '{ "a" : [ "ssl","security", "pattern"] }'::jsonb <=>
'{ a: { $all: [ "ssl","security"] } }'::mquery;
```

This mongoDB query:

```
{ a: { $all: [ "ssl","security"] } }
```

transformed to this JsQuery query:

```
a @> [ "ssl","security"]
```
and passed like arguments to JsQuery execution functions with jsonb document. 
Execution function return `true` or `false`dependently of result.

```
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
```

You cah use key `a` without quotes, but if it complicated key `"a.b.c.qwerty.d"`
you need to use them.
